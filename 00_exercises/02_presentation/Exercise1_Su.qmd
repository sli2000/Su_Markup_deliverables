## My Favourite Equation

This is the formula for calculating the interest on a loan or investment:

$$ A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} $$

Where:\
- **A**: Final amount \
- **P**: Initial principal \
- **r**: Annual interest rate\
- **n**: Number of times interest is applied per year\
- **t**:Time in years

## My Winter Sports Plan

I have two exciting plans to help me get through the Dutch winter:

1.**Visiting all Fun Forest locations**\
- Four Locations:Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Almere, Venlo\
- I have already checked off Amsterdam!\

2.**Learning Archery**\
- I missed the first round, but I'm waiting for the second one! \
