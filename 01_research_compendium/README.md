# Markup languages and reproducible programming in statistics

The objective of this manuscript is to reproduce the simulation study presented in Boulesteix, Groenwold, Abrahamowicz, et al. (2020). The original paper conducted a small-scale simulation study to examine the impact of measurement error on a (continuous) exposure and/or a (continuous) confounding variable.

The required components for reproducing the results are organized as follows:

- The dataset is stored in the **"raw_data"** subfolder.
- The R script containing all necessary commands is located in the **"Rscripts"** subfolder.
- The figure summarizing the results is saved in the **"results"** subfolder.
- The simulation study code, along with detailed comments, is provided in the **"sim_research.qmd"** Quarto document in the **"dcs"** subfolder.
- The rendered HTML version of the document is available as **"sim_research.html"** in the **"dcs"** subfolder.
